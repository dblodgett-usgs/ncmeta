\title{ncmeta: Straightforward 'NetCDF' Metadata}
\description{
Extract metadata from 'NetCDF' data sources, these can be files, file handles or servers. This package leverages and extends the lower level functions of the 'RNetCDF' package providing a consistent set of functions that all return data frames. We introduce named concepts of 'grid', 'axis' and 'source' which are all meaningful entities without formal definition in the 'NetCDF' library \url{https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}. 'RNetCDF' matches the library itself with only the named concepts of 'variables', 'dimensions' and 'attributes'.

\code{ncmeta} provides a consistent set of tools to obtain metadata from NetCDF. NetCDF
is 'Network Common Data Form' https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/.
These functions are generics, allowing methods to be written for various providers so that
everything can work from a common basis. All functions return a data frame.
}
\details{
Each function responds to a character file name or data source (i.e. URL) or to a connection of a
given class, this is so a source connection may be created a minimal number of times and kept open
while a number of entities are queried.

Each "given" entity may be referred to by index (0-based) or name, just as it would be by the NetCDF
API and by the two R wrapper providers \code{RNetCDF} and \code{ncdf4}.
